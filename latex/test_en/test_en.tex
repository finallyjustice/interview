\noindent TeX is a typesetting system (or ``formatting system'') designed and
mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. Together with the Metafont
language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces, TeX
was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce
high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would
give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time. TeX is a
free software, which has made it more accessible to a wider range of users.
