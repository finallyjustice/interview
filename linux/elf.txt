This is how x86_64 c program calls a glibc function puts.

puts@plt is at 0x400400. The first instruction of puts@plt is to jump to *0x601018=0x400406 (in .got.plt), which is the second instruction of puts@plt.

(gdb) disassemble 0x400400
Dump of assembler code for function puts@plt:
   0x0000000000400400 <+0>:	jmpq   *0x200c12(%rip)        # 0x601018

   0x000000000040040b <+11>:	jmpq   0x4003f0
End of assembler dump.

(gdb) x 0x601018
0x601018:	0x00400406

puts@plt pushes 0x0 on stack and jumps to 0x4003f0 which is at the beginning of plt section. 0x0 indicates the first entry in .rela.plt.

This piece of code first pushes 0x601008 (.got.plt) on satck and then jumps to *0x601010 (.got.plt). 0x601008 is the address of address of link_map base address.

(gdb) x/5i 0x4003f0
   0x4003f0:	pushq  0x200c12(%rip)        # 0x601008

   0x400406 <puts@plt+6>:	pushq  $0x0

(gdb) x *0x601010
   0xfffffffff7dee6a0:	Cannot access memory at address 0xfffffffff7dee6a0

This address is belong to ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. ld would init the got for puts.

There are to arguments on stack: (1) 0x0 indicates the first entry in rela.plt and (2) 0x601008 (.got.plt).

--> rela(0): r_offset=601018, r_info=100000007, r_addend=0, sym=1, type=7

(gdb) info sharedlibrary
From                To                  Syms Read   Shared Object Library
0x00007ffff7dd7ac0  0x00007ffff7df5640  Yes         /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x00007ffff7a2d8b0  0x00007ffff7b80334  Yes         /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6

Once the puts address is updated by ld, the corresponding address becomes 0xfffffffff7a7d5d0.

(gdb) x *0x601018 # in .got.plt
0xfffffffff7a7d5d0:	Cannot access memory at address 0xfffffffff7a7d5d0

This address is belong to libc.so.6.

About .got.plt:

1st entry: base of dynamic section
2nd entry: seems base of link_map
3rd entry: seems address of _dl_runtime_resolve in ld

---------------------------------------------------

elf sections:

ELF section index 0 is reserved but not used.

.plt: code section to redirect library calls, e.g., puts@plt
.got.plt: data address for address used in plt section, main()->puts@plt->addr@got.plt
.rela.plt: relocation section to calculate address (stored in got.plt) used in plt section
.shstrtab: string used for section name
.interp: ld path
.symtab: the symbol table that would be removed with stripe
.strtab: string used by symtab
.gnu.hash: hash table for symbol request externally and it is used to calculate the index in .dynsym of a symbol string
.dynsym: symbol table used in dynamic linking (symtab section is removed once we run stripe)
.rela.name: name is supplied by the section to which the relocations apply.

SYMTAB and DYNSYM: These sections hold a symbol table. Currently, an object
file may have only one section of each type, but this restriction may be
relaxed in the future. Typically, SYMTAB provides symbols for link editing,
though it may also be used for dynamic linking. As a complete symbol table, it
may contain many symbols unnecessary for dynamic linking. Consequently, an
object file may also contain a DYNSYM section, which olds a minimal set of
dynamic linking symbols, to save space.

---------------------------------------------------

Android implements its own dynamic loader and linker for native
libraries (/system/bin/linker). Unlike its counterpart in the desktop,
Android’s loader resolves all the external functions eagerly.
For example, if the app’s native code depends on the __android
_log_print function in liblog.so, the loader will promptly load
the library and recursively resolve the function address. Even though
Android does not support lazy address resolution, the PLT/GOT [9]
structure is still used for dynamic linking. More specifically, the
compiler generates a stub in the PLT section for each external function.
All calls to that function in the library are redirect to the stub,
which simply contains an indirect branch to the address in the associated
GOT entry. When a native library is loaded, the loader
resolves the address of the external function and fills it in the GOT
entry.

A relocatable file holds code and data suitable for linking with other object
files to create an executable or a shared object file.
An executable file holds a program suitable for execution; the file specifies
how exec (BA_OS) creates a program's process image.
A shared object file holds code and data suitable for linking in two contexts.

---------------------------------------------------

Support there is an executable program called "binary" and binary would print
"Hello World" via puts (in libc). Initially, the address of puts in got.plt is
one address in ld and the request to puts would be forwarded to ld via
puts@plt. ld would calculate the has of symbol name (puts), traverse each
libraries and search in buckets of gnu.hash with this hash and identify the
index of puts in dynsym section. Once entry of puts in synsym is identified,
the address of puts would be written to got.plt with the help of binary's
rela.plt. The address in got.plt would point to puts the next time when binary
calls puts.
